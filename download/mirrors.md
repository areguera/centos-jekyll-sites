CentOS welcomes new mirror sites.  If you are considering setting up a public
mirror site for CentOS, [please follow the mirror
guidelines](http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/CreatePublicMirrors) to make sure
that your mirror is consistent with the other mirror sites.  If you're
searching for mirrors providing AltArch content (like ppc64, ppc64le, aarch64,
armfhp) please use [this link](/download/altarch-mirrors/).
