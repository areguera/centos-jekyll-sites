## Cloud and container images

* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=16cb8b03-256e-4dde-8f34-1b0f377efe89)
* [Docker Registry](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/centos/)

If the above is not for you, [alternative downloads](http://wiki.centos.org/Download) might be.

## Geographical mirrors

If you're looking for a specific (or geographically local) mirror, please check out our [list of current mirrors](/download/mirrors/).

To check the status of a mirror, please visit [mirror-status.centos.org](http://mirror-status.centos.org/).

## Sources

In order to help ease the workload for our primary mirror network, the source
rpms are not kept in the same tree as the binary packages. If you need the
source packages used to build CentOS, you can find them in our vault 
[vault.centos.org](http://vault.centos.org).

## Older Versions

Legacy versions of CentOS are no longer supported. For historical purposes,
CentOS keeps an archive of older versions. If you're absolutely sure you need
an older version [then click here](http://wiki.centos.org/Download).
